# ent-vision-frontend

go to directory 

run ng serve --open

should be using port 4200, as this port is used in white list enable cors in backend

http request base url to backend is using http://localhost:50513/

for google chart im using https://github.com/FERNman/angular-google-charts

there is still few problem like after click button back and go back to chart page it doesn't render correctly.
